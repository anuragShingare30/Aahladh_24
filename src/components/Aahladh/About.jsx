        Aahladh is an annual cultural festival at IIIT Tiruchirappalli, where
        students come together to happily celebrate different cultures using
        art, literature, and traditions. This event lets students show how
        creative they are and also gives them a good opportunity to learn about
        many different things. This festival is lively and helps people from
        different cultures understand and respect each other better. It's a fun
        time to learn and have a good time.
